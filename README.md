# HTML-Recipes-Practice
This was a project created by the Odin Project made to replace the previous front-end projects and lessons in foundations I did this one for some more HTML practice

What I learned/did:
1. Use of GIT and version control
2. Use of proper HTML syntax from tags and use of proper meta tags, doctype, etc.
3. Use of links to be able to navigate to other websites and pages from this site
4. Use of images on a website

What's next:
1. More practice with css (more lessons were added)
2. Understanding of different tags of HTML not used in this project and their use-cases
